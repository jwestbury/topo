Contributing
============

I welcome your input! I want to make contributing to Topogen as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

Development Process
------------------

I use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from ``main``.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

Pull Request Process
-------------------

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
2. Update the docs with any new API changes.
3. The PR will be merged once I have reviewed and approved it.

License and Contributions
------------------------

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same license that covers the project. Feel free to contact me if that's a concern.

Reporting Issues
---------------

I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue!
